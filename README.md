# Pull request exercise

[EXERCISE] Practice git & github with a mini team repository!

- Clone the exercise repo created by your trainer.
- Create a branch named after your first name and make sure to do all your work on that branch.
- Add some basic HTML & CSS to your section of the HTML and CSS files (aim for around 3 commits overall).
- In GitHub, create a pull request from your branch to the main branch and write a brief but descriptive name & description of your pull request.
